;ANSWER
;The new-if version of sqrt OR sqrt-iter never runs forever. The difference between if and new-if is that 'if' is a special form. The interpreter will evaluate 'if' using normal order evalutation, meaning predicates evaluate before the operands.  The predicate decides which operand gets evaluated. 

;new-if is evaluated using applicative evaluation where the operands always are evaluated. In the rewritten sqrt-iter, this means that new-if will call sqrt-iter despite good-enough being evaluated to true because the operands are being evaluated. sqrt-iter calls itself forever without ever being stopped by the terminal condition.
