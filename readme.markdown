CS61A: Berkeley's intro to Computer Science class using the SICP textbook.
Most of the solutions are problems found in the slides of the course found on this
page: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/

I'm following the lectures on youtube for the spring 2011 class. The answers to the questions asked in the lectures and their notes are in the CS61A folder.

The solutions to exercises in the book are in the root folder. I've added pretty in depth explanations and walk throughs to the more complicated exercises. I'll publish them all in blog form once I have one online.
